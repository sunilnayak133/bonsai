Bonsai for Maya is a tool I developed at Carnegie Mellon University for my Technical Art Course. It is still a work in progress, and only one week has been put into it as of yet. The goal of this project was to come up with a procedural vegetation generation tool similar to Disney's Bonsai, and it is still being worked on.

It uses PyQt5 (PySide2) and has been tested on Maya 2017 and 2018. 

# Usage instructions:
1. Run the script
2. Set the sliders to whatever values you wish to set them to and then hit Apply
3. Edit the branch/trunk values’ sliders to see dynamic changes to the model.
4. When you are satisfied with the model, hit Finalize to bring up the name UI
5. Name the tree whatever you wish to name it. The UI will not allow you to enter an empty
string as a name, and it will also make sure you won’t enter a name that already exists in
the outliner.
6. Once you’re done, you can run the script as many times as you want to generate more
trees.
