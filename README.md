Bonsai for Maya is a tool I developed at Carnegie Mellon University for my Technical Art Course. It is still a work in progress, and only one week has been put into it as of yet. The goal of this project was to come up with a procedural vegetation generation tool similar to Disney's Bonsai, and it is still being worked on.

It uses PyQt5 (PySide2) and has been tested on Maya 2017 and 2018. 

You can find a video of the tool here:
