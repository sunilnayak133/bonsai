Bonsai for Maya is a tool I developed at Carnegie Mellon University for my Technical Art Course. It is still a work in progress, and only one week has been put into it as of yet. The goal of this project was to come up with a procedural vegetation generation tool similar to Disney's Bonsai, and it is still being worked on.
